# cascajal

Clojure library and/or web app for book reading

## Usage

Before you can `lein deps` or `lein run` or whatever, you need to initialize a local repo of the epublib library:
`lein localrepo install lib/epublib-core-3.1.jar nl.siegmann.epublib/epublib-core 3.1`

Now you're good to go :+1:
